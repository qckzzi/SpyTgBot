To use the bot, you need to install all the necessary libraries from the requirement.txt. Instead of "TOKEN", you need to insert the existing token of your bot, which was returned to you by BotFather.

This bot has only 2 commands: send a screenshot or screen recording lasting 5 seconds after the start of the command. Please note that all screenshots and recordings are taken from the computer on which this project is running. This bot is not used for any selfish purposes, this is my desire to replenish the library of repositories with any projects.
